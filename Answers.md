1. What is black-box testing, and how does it differ from white-box testing?
Black-Box Testing:
Black-box testing is a software testing technique where the tester does not know the internal structure or logic of the application. 
It focuses on verifying that the software functions correctly by providing inputs and checking the expected outputs.

White-Box Testing:
White-box testing, on the other hand, requires knowledge of the internal code structure. Testers examine how the application processes data,
 covering different paths, loops, and conditions.

Key Differences:
Black-box testing focuses on software behavior, while white-box testing analyzes internal logic.
Black-box testing does not require coding knowledge, while white-box testing does.
Black-box testing uses techniques like equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, whereas white-box testing includes statement coverage and branch testing.
For example, in testing a login page:

A black-box tester enters valid and invalid credentials to check the output.
A white-box tester examines the code handling password encryption and authentication logic.

2. Explain the concept of equivalence partitioning and how it helps in reducing test cases.
Equivalence Partitioning (EP):
Equivalence partitioning is a black-box testing technique that divides input data into groups where all values in a group are expected to produce the same result.
 Instead of testing every possible input, a single representative value is chosen from each group.

How It Reduces Test Cases:
Instead of testing all possible inputs, testers only select one value per group.
It ensures that all input types are covered efficiently.
Helps in identifying issues without redundant tests.
Example:
If a system accepts numbers between 1 and 100, the input can be divided into:

Below 1 (invalid, e.g., 0)
Between 1 and 100 (valid, e.g., 50)
Above 100 (invalid, e.g., 150)
By selecting one value from each group (0, 50, 150), the number of test cases is reduced while still covering all input types.

3. What is boundary value analysis, and why is it useful in software testing?
Boundary Value Analysis (BVA):
Boundary Value Analysis is a technique that focuses on testing values at the edges (boundaries) of input ranges. Since errors often occur at the boundaries, this technique is crucial for detecting defects.

Why It’s Useful:
It catches errors that may be missed when testing only typical input values.
Reduces the number of test cases while maximizing test effectiveness.
Ensures the system behaves correctly at critical points.
Example:
For a system that allows numbers from 1 to 100:

The lower boundary test cases would be 0 (invalid), 1 (valid), and 2 (valid).
The upper boundary test cases would be 99 (valid), 100 (valid), and 101 (invalid).
By testing these values, potential issues at the edges of the input range can be detected.

4. Describe the purpose of decision tables in black-box testing and provide an example scenario where they might be used.
Purpose of Decision Tables:
Decision tables are used in black-box testing to handle situations where multiple conditions affect an outcome. They help ensure all possible input combinations are considered.

Example Scenario:
Consider an e-commerce system that offers discounts based on two conditions:

Whether the user is a registered member.
Whether the order value exceeds $100.
In this case:

A non-member with an order below $100 gets no discount.
A non-member with an order above $100 gets a 5% discount.
A registered member with an order below $100 gets a 10% discount.
A registered member with an order above $100 gets a 20% discount.
By organizing these conditions into a structured format, testers can verify that all scenarios work correctly.

5. What is state transition testing, and how can it be applied to a user account system?
State Transition Testing:
State transition testing is a technique used to evaluate how a system changes between different states based on inputs and events.
 This is useful for applications where actions depend on previous states.

Application in a User Account System:
In a user login system, the states may include:

Start State – The user has not attempted to log in.
Logged Out State – The user enters an incorrect password.
Logged In State – The user enters the correct password.
Locked State – The account is locked after multiple failed login attempts.
Example:

A user enters the correct password and moves from the "Start State" to the "Logged In State."
If the user enters the wrong password, they remain in the "Logged Out State."
If the user fails three consecutive attempts, they transition to the "Locked State," preventing further logins.
By using state transition testing, testers can ensure that the system properly handles different login attempts and transitions between states.
